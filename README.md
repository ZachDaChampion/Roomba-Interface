# Roomba Interface
 
A quick and dirty Python interface for iRobot products using the [*iRobot® Create® 2 Open Interface (OI)*](https://www.irobotweb.com/~/media/MainSite/PDFs/About/STEM/Create/iRobot_Roomba_600_Open_Interface_Spec.pdf?la=en)

This is currently made for personal use, although I may expand it to become a more general-purpose library in the future.
